# AVIATION INCIDENT PREDICTION

**Insight:**
This project utilizes the most up-to-date data from the Department of Transportation, incorporating crashed flights and on-time flights data spanning from 1990 to 2024.

**Purpose:**
Our predictive model aims to achieve the following:
* **Enhanced Safety:** Reduce aviation accidents and incidents, ultimately saving lives and preventing injuries.
* **Proactive Risk Management:** Enable the anticipation of potential hazards for effective mitigation and prevention, moving beyond a reactive approach.
* **Resource Allocation:** Optimize the distribution of resources for inspections, maintenance, and training by accurately predicting high-risk periods, areas, and circumstances.
* **Cost Reduction:** Minimize costs associated with delays, damages, legal fees, reputational damage, and most importantly, prevent the tragic loss of life.
* **Improved Operational Efficiency:** Foster a seamless and efficient travel experience for everyone involved by minimizing disruptions and negative incidents.

**Installation:**
To get started with this project:

1.  **Fork the Repository:** Click the "Fork" button at the top right of this page to create a copy of this repository in your GitHub account.
2.  **Run in Codespace:** Once you've forked the repository, navigate to your forked version and click the "Code" button. From the dropdown menu, select "Create codespace on main". This will open a pre-configured development environment in your browser.
3.  **Run [01-data_acquisition.ipynb](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/aviation_final_project/blob/main/src/01-data_acquisition.ipynb):** Within the Codespace environment, you will find the Explorer tab and see workspace src, click the drop down and you will see notebook 01-data_acquisition.ipynb, click the notebook and once in the notebook press run all to start acquiring and gathering the data 
4.  **Run [02-data_preparation.ipynb](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/aviation_final_project/blob/main/src/02-data_preparation.ipynb)** and again press run all function and you will see the data be prepared, visualized, encoded and train-test split for modelling
5.  **Run [03-model_building_Dyimah.ipynb](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/aviation_final_project/blob/main/src/03-model_building_Dyimah.ipynb)**, again press run all function and you will see the train and test data uploaded, the model we chose to use for the data, you will the model optimized and the results before and after optimization of the model

**Model Performance Summary**
The Aviation Incidence Prediction model achieved high performance, with around 99.7% accuracy on unseen data. It excels at correctly identifying non-incident cases (very low false positive rate). However, it has a slightly higher error rate in missing actual incident cases (around 8% false negatives).
Attempts to optimize the model's settings didn't significantly change its overall accuracy. Further examination of the model's predictions for incident cases is important to ensure a good balance between correctly identifying true incidents and minimizing missed cases, especially given the potential impact of false negatives.
